# PROBLEM STATEMENT


# Milestone #2: Adding in All Planets
# Mars is not the only planet in our solar system with its own unique gravity. In fact, each planet has a different gravitational constant, which affects how much an object would weigh on that planet. Below is a list of the constants for each planet compared to Earth's gravity:

# Mercury: 37.6%

# Venus: 88.9%

# Mars: 37.8%

# Jupiter: 236.0%

# Saturn: 108.1%

# Uranus: 81.5%

# Neptune: 114.0%

# Write a Python program that prompts an Earthling to enter their weight on Earth and then to enter the name of a planet in our solar system. The program should print the equivalent weight on that planet rounded to 2 decimal places if necessary.

# You can assume that the user will always type in a planet with the first letter capitalized and you do not need to worry about the case where they type in something other than one of the above planets.

# SOLUTION :

# Constants 

# for gravity factors of planets compared to Earth
# (Earth's gravity is 1.0)
