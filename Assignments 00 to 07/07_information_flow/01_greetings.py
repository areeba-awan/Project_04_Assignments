# 01_greetings.py

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

# We've written a helper function for you called greet(name) which takes as input a string name and prints a greeting. Write some code in main() to get the user's name and then greet them, being sure to call the greet(name) helper function.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input in bold italics):

# What's your name? Sophia

# Greetings Sophia!

# SOLUTION

def main():
    print(f"\n ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Personalized Greeting Program! ðŸŒŸ")
    print("\n âœ¨ Let's make someone feel special with a warm greeting! ðŸ’–\n")

    # Prompt user for their name
    name: str = input("\n ðŸ’¬ What's your name? ")

    # Call the greet function and display the result
    print(f"\n ðŸŽ‰ {greet(name)} ðŸŽ‰")
    print(f"\n ðŸŒˆ Thanks for stopping by! Have a wonderful day! ðŸŒŸ")

def greet(name):
    """
    âœ¨ Generates a personalized greeting for the given name. âœ¨
    """
    return f"Greetings, {name}! ðŸ˜Š"
