# PROBLEM STATEMENT :

# Problem Statement
# Write a program that prints the first 20 even numbers. There are several correct approaches, but they all 
# use a loop of some sort. Do no write twenty print statements

# The first even number is 0:

# 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38

# SOLUTION :

def main():
    """Main function to display the first 20 even numbers"""
    print(F"\nðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Even Number Generator! ðŸŒŸ")
    print("\n âœ¨ Get ready to see the first 20 even numbers! ðŸš€")
    print("\n ðŸ”¢  First 20 even numbers are:")
    
    # Loop to print the first 20 even numbers
    for i in range(0, 40, 2):
        print(f"\n ðŸŸ¢ {i}", end=" ")

    print(f"\n ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for using the program! Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š")
