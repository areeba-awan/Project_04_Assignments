# PROBLEM STATEMENT

# Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! We've written a main() function for you 
# which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

# Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is Sophia (the autograder expects
#  the returned name to be Sophia):

# Howdy Sophia ! ðŸ¤ 

# SOLUTION

def get_name(name):
    """
    âœ¨ Function to return the name passed as input.
    """
    return name

def main():
    print(f"\n ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the Personalized Greeting Program! ðŸŒŸ")
    print("\n ðŸŽ‰ Let's greet someone in style! ðŸ¤ \n")

    # Calling the get_name function
    print(f"\n Howdy, {get_name('Areeba')}! ðŸ¤  Hope youâ€™re having a fantastic day! ðŸŒˆ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
