# 04_double.py

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

# Fill out the double(num) function to return the result of multiplying num by 2. We've written a main() 
# function for you which asks the user for a number, calls your code for double(num) , and prints the result.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input in bold italics):

# Enter a number: 2 Double that is 4

# SOLUTION

def main(number):
    """
    ðŸŒŸ Function to calculate the double of the given number. ðŸŒŸ
    """
    double_number = number * 2
    return double_number

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"\nðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Number Doubler Program! ðŸŒŸ")
    print("\n ðŸ”¢  Enter a number, and I'll double it for you. Ready? ðŸš€\n")
    
    # User input
    number = int(input(f"\n ðŸ’¬ Enter a number: "))
    
    # Calculate the result using the main function
    result = main(number)
    
    # Display the result with emojis
    print(f"\n âœ¨ You entered: {number}")
    print(f"\n ðŸŽ¯ Double that is: {result}")
    
    print("\nðŸŽ‰ Thanks for using the Number Doubler! Keep having fun with numbers! ðŸ’¡")
