# PROBLEM STATEMENT

# Fill out the chaotic_counting() function, which prints the numbers from 1 to 10, but with a catch. 
# We've written a done() function which returns True with likelihood DONE_LIKELIHOOD -- at each number, 
# before printing the number, you should call done() and check if it returns True or not. If done() returns True,
#  we're done counting, and you should use a return statement to end the chaotic_counting() function execution
#  and resume execution of main(), which will print "I'm done.". We've written main() for you -- check it out!
#  Notice that we'll only print "I'm done" from main() once chaotic_counting() is done with its execution.

# Here's a sample run of this program:

# I'm going to count until 10 or until I feel like stopping, whichever comes first. 1 2 3 I'm done.

# SOLUTION

import random  # ‚úÖ Import random module

DONE_LIKELIHOOD = 0.3  # üé≤ Probability setting for when to stop

    üåü Counts numbers from 1 to 10, stopping randomly based on DONE_LIKELIHOOD.
